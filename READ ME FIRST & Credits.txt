LUA INSTRUCTIONS:

Look for (Ctrl+F Search) CHARNAME, CHARNAME2, FILENAME

Replace FILENAME with the exact name of the file that you put in your mod folders. Ex -> "FILENAME_geo" i'd rename "tsonic_geo"

Replace CHARNAME with your character's name as normally written.

Replace CHARNAME2 with an abbreviation of your character's name, ex -> Toei Sonic becomes "TSONIC" (IN ALL CAPS)

There are other sections where you may write descriptions for your characters/other information that will appear in game.


Feel free to delete this and the Reminders txt file from this folder once you are done with them.
