I have been tasked by the super pretty slime gal to think of stuff for her peak mod. Here's what I got.

Cannot be squashed
Minecraft size attribute command (if yk yk)
Death message compatibility with [CS] Gamma and [CS] The Definitive CT Himself
Make Sugar still controllable when on fire
Squash n' Stretch (Saul, you know what to do)

(More may be added in later, I'll post my code for some of these ideas for her to use)
